# wf-align (CSE185 Project Demo)

(Work in progress!)

This is a demonstration project for CSE185. It implements a smaller, simpler version of bwa-backtrack. See the [BWA](https://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net) page for more details.

# Install instructions

Installation doesn't require any additional libraries.

Navigate to the directory in which you would like to download this tool and use the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/WillardFord/wf-align-CSE185
```
Change into that directory and install the tool so that it can be used from the command line.
You can install `wf-align` with the following command:

```
cd wf-align-CSE185
```
```
python setup.py install
```

Note: if you do not have root access, you can run the commands above with additional options to install locally:

```
python setup.py install --user
```

If the install was successful, typing `wf-align --help` should show a useful message.

# Basic usage

The basic usage of `wf-align` is:

```
wf-align reference.fa reads.fq [-o output.sam] [other options]
```

To run `wf-align` on a small test example (using files in this repo):
```
wf-align example-files/test_reference.fa example-files/test_reads.fastq 
```

This should produce the output below:
```
@HD VN:1.6 SO:unknown
SEQ_ID_1        0       chrTEST 3       255     10M     0       0       10      CTAGCTACGT      FFFFFFFFFF
SEQ_ID_2        0       chrTEST2        1       255     10M     0       0       10      TAGCTAGGTT      HHHHHHHHHH
SEQ_ID_3        0       chrTEST 57      255     8M      0       0       8       GCTAGCAT        HHHHHHHH
```

To compare to output of `bwa mem`, run:
```
bwa mem example-files/test_reference.fa example-files/test_reads.fastq
```

# SARS Cov2 Example

Reference genome available [here](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/NC_045512).



# wf-align options

There are 2 required inputs to `wf-align`, a reference fasta file and a fastq file containing reads. Users may additionally specify the options below:

* `-o FILE`, `--output FILE`: Write output to file. By default, output is written to stdout.

# File format

The output file format is the same as the bwa mem method, a sam file. See: https://samtools.github.io/hts-specs/SAMv1.pdf

# Testing

To run tests:
```
# Run command line tests
sh tests/cmdline_tests.sh

# Run unit tests
python -m pytest --cov=.
```

# Methodology

I used several different resources to come up with my own hand-stitched methodology:
